```
Attached is the attributes file for batches 1-6. Batches 1-3 consists on the first 360 cases (what GDC calls their batch 1) and the remaining belongs to their batch2.
```

See preliminary work on epazote:/Users/mwyczalk/Projects/CPTAC3/CPTAC3.Cases/cases.analysis.HarmonizationBatch2
for conversion XLXS -> TSV and dsease remapping
Copying CPTAC3.HB12.cases.tsv from above directory to dat/CPTAC3.Harmonized.Batch2.cases.dat

Work here based in part on `../discover.CPTAC3.harmonized`.  In particular, we examine `dat` directory from there to allow
short-circuiting of analyses which have already been performed.
